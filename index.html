    <h1>Porgraming Language</h1>
    <p>A programming language is a computer language programmers use to develop software programs, scripts, or other sets of instructions for computers to execute.
Although many languages share similarities, each has its own syntax. Once a programmer learns the languages rules, syntax, and structure, they write the source code in a text editor or IDE. Then, the programmer often compiles the code into machine language that can be understood by the computer. Scripting languages, which do not require a compiler, use an interpreter to execute the script.
</p>
   <h2>Types of programming languages:</h2>
    </br>
   <h2>1.	High level _low level  </h2>
    <p> Sometimes abbreviated as HLL, a high-level language is a computer programming language that isn't limited by the computer, designed for a specific job, and is easier to understand. It is more like human language and less like machine language. However, for a computer to understand and run a program created with a high-level language,  Low-level programming languages are closer to machine code, or binary. Therefore, they’re more difficult for humans to read (although they’re still easier to understand than 1s and 0s). The benefit of low-level languages is that they’re fast and offer precise control over how the computer will function.it must be compiled into machine language. like C++, COBOL, FORTRAN, Java, Pascal, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Visual Basic.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>2.   Declarative programming</h2>
    
    <p>is a computer programming paradigm that the developer defines what the program should accomplish rather than explicitly defining how it should go about doing so. This approach lends itself naturally to the programmatic definition of formal logic systems, and has the benefit of simplifying the programming of some parallel processing applications like ABSET , Absys , JavaFX Script</p>

    <br>
    <h2>3.	General-purpose / domain-specific </h2>
<p>A general-purpose language is a programming language that is capable of creating all types of programs. For example, C is a good example of a general-purpose language.
A language that is not a general-purposed language is called a DSL (domain-specific language). For example, HTML, Logo, MATLAB are examples of domain-specific languages.
</p>
    <br>
    <h2>4.	Object-oriented / concurrent </h2>
    <p>known as OOP or OO programming, is a programming language paradigm. In an object-oriented program, the code can be structured as reusable components, some of which may share properties or behaviors.
Object-oriented programming can improve the developer's ability to quickly prototype software, extend existing functionality, refactor the code, and maintain it as it's developed.
</p>
    <br>
    <h2>5.	Command / Compiled / Script language</h2>
    <p>A good example of a command language is Microsoft Windows batch files. Although command languages are useful for executing a series of commands, their functionality is limited to what's available at the command line making them easier to learn.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h2>Most popular programming languages :</h2>
    <h2>Python</h2>
    <p>   Python is a versatile, general-purpose programming language. It can be used in a variety of fields from data science and machine learning to web development and is a great first language to learn.</p> <br>
    
    <h2>Java</h2>
    <p>    Another language that’s great when you’re starting out, Java can be used for many things, including mobile applications, software development, and large systems development. AP Computer Science is currently taught in Java.</p> <br>
